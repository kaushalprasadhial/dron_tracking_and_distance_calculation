# dron_tracking_and_distance_calculation

### Problem Statement

You need to detect and track a high-speed drone of size 1m (L) x 0.5m (W) flying towards you at speeds between 50 - 75 km/hr. The drone starts from a distance of 2500m at an altitude of 1000m, and you are at a height of 1.5m. The solution must calculate the drone's distance from you and its speed in real-time, using one or more cameras.

### Solution Approach

**Hardware:**
1. **Cameras:** Two high-resolution cameras (for stereo vision) mounted at a fixed distance apart for depth perception.
2. **Processing Unit:** A powerful GPU-enabled computer (e.g., with an NVIDIA GPU) for real-time image processing and calculations.
3. **Mounts and Stabilizers:** Tripods or mounts to stabilize the cameras.
4. **Communication Interface:** Network setup for data transfer if needed.

**Software:**
1. **OpenCV:** For image processing and computer vision tasks.
2. **TensorFlow/PyTorch:** For potential deep learning models to enhance detection and tracking.
3. **Custom Algorithms:** For calculating distance and speed.
4. **Programming Language:** Python for ease of use with libraries like OpenCV.

**Assumptions:**
1. The drone has distinguishable features that can be detected by the camera.
2. Adequate lighting conditions for the cameras to capture clear images.
3. The environment is relatively open without significant obstructions.

**Challenges/Limitations:**
1. **Lighting Conditions:** Poor lighting can affect detection accuracy.
2. **Obstructions:** Any objects between the camera and drone can interfere with detection.
3. **Processing Speed:** High-speed drones require fast processing to ensure real-time tracking.
4. **Calibration:** Precise calibration of cameras is necessary for accurate depth calculation.

### Solution Steps

1. **Camera Setup:**
   - Mount two cameras at a known fixed distance apart to create a stereo vision system.
   - Calibrate the cameras to determine their intrinsic and extrinsic parameters.

2. **Detection:**
   - Use image processing techniques or a pre-trained deep learning model to detect the drone in each frame.
   - Identify corresponding points (features) on the drone in images from both cameras.

3. **Distance Calculation:**
   - Calculate the disparity between the positions of the drone in images from both cameras.
   - Use the disparity to compute the depth (distance from the cameras) using the formula:  
     \[ \text{Distance} = \frac{f \times B}{d} \]  
     where \( f \) is the focal length of the cameras, \( B \) is the baseline (distance between the cameras), and \( d \) is the disparity.

4. **Speed Calculation:**
   - Track the drone over multiple frames to determine its movement.
   - Calculate the speed by measuring the change in position over time.

### Sample Code

Here is a simplified version of the implementation:

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Stereo vision setup
cam_left = cv2.VideoCapture(0)  # Left camera
cam_right = cv2.VideoCapture(1)  # Right camera

# Function to calculate distance
def calculate_distance(disparity, focal_length, baseline):
    return (focal_length * baseline) / disparity

# Focal length and baseline (example values)
focal_length = 700  # in pixels
baseline = 0.5  # in meters

while True:
    # Capture frames from both cameras
    ret_left, frame_left = cam_left.read()
    ret_right, frame_right = cam_right.read()
    
    if not ret_left or not ret_right:
        break
    
    # Convert frames to grayscale
    gray_left = cv2.cvtColor(frame_left, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    gray_right = cv2.cvtColor(frame_right, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    
    # Detect drone in both images (simple thresholding example)
    _, thresh_left = cv2.threshold(gray_left, 200, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY)
    _, thresh_right = cv2.threshold(gray_right, 200, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY)
    
    # Find contours (assuming the drone is the largest white blob)
    contours_left, _ = cv2.findContours(thresh_left, cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)
    contours_right, _ = cv2.findContours(thresh_right, cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)
    
    if contours_left and contours_right:
        # Get bounding boxes of the largest contour
        x_left, y_left, w_left, h_left = cv2.boundingRect(contours_left[0])
        x_right, y_right, w_right, h_right = cv2.boundingRect(contours_right[0])
        
        # Calculate the disparity
        disparity = abs(x_left - x_right)
        
        if disparity != 0:
            # Calculate the distance
            distance = calculate_distance(disparity, focal_length, baseline)
            print(f"Distance to drone: {distance:.2f} meters")
    
    # Display the frames
    cv2.imshow('Left Camera', frame_left)
    cv2.imshow('Right Camera', frame_right)
    
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

# Release the cameras and close windows
cam_left.release()
cam_right.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

### Explanation

1. **Camera Initialization:** Two cameras are initialized to capture video frames.
2. **Image Processing:** Frames are converted to grayscale, and thresholding is applied to simplify detection.
3. **Disparity Calculation:** The disparity between corresponding points in the left and right images is calculated.
4. **Distance Calculation:** The distance to the drone is computed using the disparity, focal length, and baseline.
5. **Display:** Frames from both cameras are displayed for real-time monitoring.

This is a basic implementation. In a real-world scenario, more robust detection methods and additional error handling would be required.
